# tiburoncin

Small man in the middle tool to inspect the traffic between two endpoints.
Mostly to be used for students wanting to know what data is flowing in a TCP channel.

## Usage

First, run the "server"

```shell
nc -l -p 8082 127.0.0.1
```

Then start `tiburoncin`

```shell
./tiburoncin -s 127.0.0.1:8081 -d 127.0.0.1:8082
```

And finally start the "client"

```shell
nc 127.0.0.1 8081
```

Use your server/client as you wish, all the traffic flowing in the channel will be captured and displayed by `tiburoncin`.

The following diagram depicts what's going on:

```
+-----------------+           +--------------------------------+
|    <client>     |      8081 |      <man in the middle>       |
| nc 127.0.0.1 \  |===========| tiburoncin -s 127.0.0.1:8081 \ |
|    8081         |           |            -d 127.0.0.1:8082   |
+-----------------+           +--------------------------------+
                                             || 8082
+-----------------+                          ||
|    <server>     |                          ||
| nc -l -p 8082 \ |==========================//
|   127.0.0.      |           
+-----------------+      
```

### Capture example

```
Connecting to dst 127.0.0.1:8082...
Waiting for a connection from src 127.0.0.1:8081...
Allocating buffers: 2048 and 2048 bytes...
src -> dst sent 29 bytes
00000000  49 27 6d 20 74 68 65 20  63 6c 69 65 6e 74 20 73  |I'm the client s|
00000010  65 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 27  68 69 21 27 0a           |ending 'hi!'.   |
dst is 29 bytes behind
dst is in sync
dst -> src sent 45 bytes
00000000  41 6e 64 20 49 27 6d 20  74 68 65 20 73 65 72 76  |And I'm the serv|
00000010  65 72 20 73 61 79 69 6e  67 20 27 68 69 20 61 6e  |er saying 'hi an|
00000020  64 20 67 6f 6f 64 20 62  79 65 21 27 0a           |d good bye!'.   |
src is 45 bytes behind
src is in sync
src is in sync
dst is in sync
```

### Help

```
./tiburoncin -s <src> -d <dst> [-b <bsz>] [-z <bsz>] [-o]
 where <src> and <dst> can be of the form:
  - host:serv
  - :serv
  - serv
 If it is not specified, host will be localhost.
 In all the cases the host can be a hostname or an IP;
 for the service it can be a servicename or a port number.
 
 -b <bsz> sets the buffer size of tiburocin
 where <bsz> is a size in bytes of the form:
  - num      sets the size of both buffers to that value
  - num:num  sets sizes for src->dst and dst->src buffers
 by default, both buffers are of 2048 bytes
 
 -z <bsz> sets the buffer size of the sockets
 where <bsz> is a size in bytes of the form:
  - num      sets the size of both buffers SND and RCV to that value
  - num:num  sets sizes for SND and RCV buffers
 by default, both buffers are not changed. See man socket(7)
 
 -o save the received data onto two files:
  dump.stod for the data received from src
  dump.dtos for the data received from dst
 in both cases a raw hexdump is saved which can be recovered later
 running 'xxd -p -c 16 -r <raw hexdump file>'. See man xxd(1)
```

## How to compile it

You will need `make` and `gcc` with support for `c99`. Then just run:

```shell
make compile
```

### Run the tests

```shell
make test
```

## How to contribute

Make a fork and start to hack. 
Keep your code as clean as possible and following the same coding style that the rest of the code and making small commits.
